Genetic-Planner
===============

This program is an experimental flight planner for simulated unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e. UAVs or "drones").
I wrote it as part of my master's thesis, [Sensor-Driven Hierarchical Path Planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Using Canonical Tasks and Sensors](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/3798/).

It uses genetic algorithms to plan a flight that satisfies some basic tasks.

As part of the same work I wrote a more complex/capable flight planner that uses hierarchical methods. It's available at https://github.com/raptorswing/FlightPlanner
